This will hopefully some day be a compiler for kasserole, targeting LLVM.

Steps of the compiler:

0. kitchen - drives the compiler, running each step
1. tokenizer - reads source and stringifies it into a list of strings, and then interprets that into tokens (keywords, identifiers, symbols, brackets, etc)
2. parser -

Development will happen on the branches.
